## About

The website is a platform for doctors worldwide to register, provide online consultations, and efficiently manage their schedules. Doctors can easily view their appointments in user-friendly calendars, update their profiles, and set their preferred working hours. To ensure punctuality, doctors receive a notification 5 minutes prior to each scheduled Zoom meeting. The platform facilitates seamless communication between doctors and patients through Zoom calls and an online chat feature. It offers a secure and convenient way for patients to schedule appointments, share medical records, and receive personalized care from a diverse range of doctors. By leveraging technology, the website aims to enhance accessibility to healthcare and empower doctors with greater control over their practice.

## Availability page
The remote doctor has the ability to create their own schedule and indicates the days and hours he is available in the calendar. These working hours can later be used to schedule appointments.
